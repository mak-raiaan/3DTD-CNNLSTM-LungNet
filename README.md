# Three-Dimensional Time Distributed Convolutional Neural Network-Long short-term memory (TD-CNNLSTM-LungNet)

This repository contains the official implementation of the **Three-Dimensional Time-Distributed Convolutional Neural Network‚ÄìLong Short-Term Memory (TD-CNNLSTM-LungNet)** model, developed for the classification of pulmonary abnormalities using ultrasound video sequences. The proposed framework integrates a Time-Distributed Convolutional Neural Network (TD-CNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to effectively capture both spatial and temporal patterns. This integration enhances classification accuracy while improving the interpretability of the model's decision-making process.

## üî¨ Overview

TD-CNNLSTM-LungNet integrates Time-Distributed Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory units to effectively capture spatial representations and temporal dynamics from ultrasound video sequences, enabling robust classification of pulmonary abnormalities.
